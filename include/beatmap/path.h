/**
 * \brief Compute an arc of circle from 3 points.
 *
 * See #oshu::arc to see how arcs are defined in oshu!.
 *
 * In beatmaps, the arcs are defined in a hard to manipulate way, so this
 * function in the geometry module is meant to help the parser generate arcs.
 *
 * Sometimes, the 3 points won't define a valid circle, for example when two
 * points are equal, or when the three points are aligned. In these case, one
 * might want to fallback on a linear path of something, but that's out of the
 * scope of this function.
 *
 * The first part in building the arc is finding the center. For the gory
 * details, see the implementation. Next is computing the radius and the
 * angles, but that's not even hard. Then, the last tricky point is finding on
 * which side of the circle the pass-through point is. While 3 points define a
 * circle, there are always two ways to go from any point A to any point B:
 * going clockwise or counter-clockwise. To know which side to take, we compute
 * the cross product of the vector AB and AC. Its sign tells whether B is on
 * the left side of AC, or on the right side. If it's on the left side (resp.
 * right side), that means the path goes clockwise (resp. counter-clockwise).
 * Then, to respect that direction in t-coordinates, we must ensure that
 * counter-clockwise (resp. clockwise) arcs have an end angle greater (resp.
 * lesser) than the start angle. If that's not the case, we add or subtract +2π
 * to one of the angles.
 *
 * \param a First point of the arc.
 * \param b Pass-through point of the arc.
 * \param c Last point of the arc.
 * \param arc Where to write the results. It doesn't have to be initialized,
 *            only allocated. Its content is unspecified on failure.
 *
 * \return 0 on success, -1 if the arc computation failed.

/**
 * A Bézier path, made up of one or many Bézier segments.
 *
 * A Bézier segment is defined by its degree, and a number of control points
 * equal to its degree plus one.
 *
 * Used by #oshu::BEZIER_PATH segments.
 *
 * For example, a degree 2 Bézier segment (called *quadratic*) has 3 control
 * points.
 *
 * Here's a complex slider to illustrate:
 * `166,250,154868,2,0,B|186:244|210:242|210:242|232:248|254:250|254:250|279:243|302:242,1,131.25,2|0,1:2|0:0,0:0:0:0:`.
 *
 * The `B|` part tells us it's a Bézier curve. You'll notice the point
 * `254:250` appear twice, meaning it's a *red point* according to the osu!
 * official doc. In better words, it's the end of one segment and the start of
 * the next one.
 *
 * We can therefore split the slider above in the following segments:
 *
 * 1. 166:250 (at the very beginning of the line), 186:244, 210:242. That
 *    makes a quadratic Bézier.
 * 2. 210:242, 232:248, 254:250.
 * 3. 254:250, 279:243, 302:242.
 *
 * The 3 segments joined together form a path.
 *
 * To make a continous path, the end point of a segment must be the same as
 * the beginning point of the next one.
 *
 * Bézier segments in oshu implement two coordinates systems. The first one is
 * the t-coordinate system, which is the one you see in the explicit definition
 * of the Bézier curves everywhere. The second one is more specific and meant
 * for oshu. Let's call it the l-coordinate system, where l ranges between 0
 * and 1, and represents how far the point is from the start. For example,
 * l=1/2 means that the point is at the middle of the curve, as opposed to
 * t=1/2 which means, for quadratic curves, that the point is closest to the
 * middle control point. See #oshu::normalize_path.
