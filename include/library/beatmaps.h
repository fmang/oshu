 * Manage a collection of beatmaps.

 * Here is the expected directory structure of the beatmaps library:
 *
 * ```
 * root
 * └── 651934 Kaori Oda - Zero Tokei (Short ver.)
 *     ├── audio.mp3
 *     ├── bg1.jpg
 *     ├── Kaori Oda - Zero Tokei (Short ver.) (ShogunMoon) [Easy].osu
 *     ├── Kaori Oda - Zero Tokei (Short ver.) (ShogunMoon) [Normal].osu
 *     └── Kaori Oda - Zero Tokei (Short ver.) (ShogunMoon) [Shining].osu
 * ```
 *
 * The root above is the path you give to #find_beatmap_sets. Something like
 * `~/.oshu/beatmaps/`.
 *
 * The beatmap set is `651934 Kaori Oda - Zero Tokei (Short ver.)`, and
 * contains 3 beatmaps entry.
