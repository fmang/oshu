.TH OSHU "1" "February 2018" "oshu! @PROJECT_VERSION@" "User Manual"

.SH NAME
oshu \- Fast port of the osu! rhythm game

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oshu
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
\fIBEATMAP\fR.osu

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Play a \fB.osu\fR beatmap file. Most linked files are automatically found from
the data inside the beatmap file.
.PP
On startup, oshu moves to the real directory of the beatmap, where it expects
to find the audio file. This lets you symlink your .osu files without bothering
with the related audio and picture files. In more technical terms, symbolic
terms are dereferenced.
.PP
\fB.osz\fR files are not supported, but since they're just fancy ZIP files, you
just have to unzip them into a sub-directory. Be careful though, it won't
create the sub-directory by itself if you naively unzip it.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity. This will print more informational messages, which may
contain useful information for understanding errors when fixing issues. Mention
it twice and you'll get debugging messages. Thrice at your own risks.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Show a brief help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-autoplay\fR
Perform a perfect run on the beatmap without any user interaction.
.TP
\fB\-\-pause\fR
Start the game in a paused state. Might be useful when you're starting the game
from a terminal as you won't be holding your mouse when the game starts.

.SH CONTROLS
.PP
The game is controlled from the keyboard and mouse. The keys are based on
osu!'s default settings, and rely on the \fIphysical\fR position on a QWERTY
keyboard. If you use a different keyboard layout, the keys are going to be at
the same position, even if the letters are different.
.SS Standard mode
.PP
Here are the official keys for the osu!standard mode:
.TP
\fBZ, X, mouse click\fR
Hit an object.
.SS Common keys
.PP
The following keys are common to all modes:
.TP
\fBEscape\fR
Toggle pause.
.TP
\fBPage up\fR
Rewind the song by 10 seconds, and leave a 1-second break.
.TP
\fBPage down\fR
Forward the song by 20 seconds.
.SS Pause
.PP
When the game is paused, your local keyboard layout is used.
These keys also apply to the score screen at the end.
.TP
\fBQ\fR
Quit the game.

.SH SKINS
.PP
The default sound effects played when hit objects are hit are defined by the
\fIskin\fR in osu! terminology. A skin directory contains a collection of
\fI.wav\fR files, like \fInormal-hitnormal.wav\fR, or
\fIsoft-hitwhistle.wav\fR.
.PP
All the sample files are optional. If a beatmap refers to a missing sample,
nothing is played.
.PP
The skins are located at \fI@OSHU_SKINS_DIRECTORY@\fR. The default skin is
\fI@OSHU_DEFAULT_SKIN@\fR. These values are configured at build time, but you
may alter the skins directory and the \fIdefault\fR symlink inside it to change
these settings.
.PP
On invocation, a non-default skin may be selected with the \fIOSHU_SKIN\fR
environment variable. If it contains a skin name, like \fIminimal\fR, it is
searched for inside the skins directory. You may also specify an absolute path.
When \fIOSHU_SKIN\fR is incorrect or refers to an unknown skin, oshu! falls
back to the default skin. You can use the --verbose flag to debug it.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
oshu! currently doesn't read a configuration file, but reads the environment.
You may configure oshu! from your .bashrc, or by creating a wrapper script
\fIexport\fRing your variables.
.PP
Here's the list of supported environment variables:
.TP
\fBOSHU_WINDOW_SIZE\fR
This variable specifies the default window size when the game start. Its value
must conform to the format \fI960x720\fR, where 960 is the width in pixels, and
720 the height in pixels. When omitted or invalid, the game starts with a
fallback default size of 960x720.
.TP
\fBOSHU_QUALITY\fR
This variables controls the visual effects and other rendering quality
settings. It may take one of \fIlow\fR, \fImedium\fR, and \fIhigh\fR. The
default is \fIhigh\fR.
.TP
\fBOSHU_SKIN\fR
Refer to the SKINS section above.
