 *
 * To find sample files, just download any beatmap you find on the official
 * Osu! website. The .osz files are just ZIP files. After you extract them,
 * you'll find the .osu files we're going to parse in this module.
 *
 * A \e .osu file is some kind of pseudo-INI, with sections written like
 * `[Metadata]` and key values, except they're written `key: value`. Some
 * sections are completely unlike INI, but pretty something like CSV.
 *
 * Because the format is so chaotic, the parser will happily ignore things it
 * doesn't understand, and generate a few warnings.
