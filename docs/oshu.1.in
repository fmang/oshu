.TH OSHU "1" "November 2017" "oshu! @VERSION@" "User Manual"

.SH NAME
oshu \- Lightweight port of the osu! rhythm game

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oshu
\fIBEATMAP\fR.osu

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Play a \fB.osu\fR beatmap file. Most linked files are automatically found from
the data inside the beatmap file.
.PP
On startup, oshu moves to the real directory of the beatmap, where it expects
to find the audio file. This lets you symlink your .osu files without bothering
with the related audio and picture files. In more technical terms, symbolic
terms are dereferenced.
.PP
\fB.osz\fR files are not supported, but since they're just fancy ZIP files, you
just have to unzip them into a sub-directory. Be careful though, it won't
create the sub-directory by itself if you naively unzip it.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity. This will print debugging messages, which may contain
useful information for understanding errors when fixing issues. Mention it
twice and you'll get verbose debugging messages.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Show a brief help message.
.TP
\fB\-\-autoplay\fR
Perform a perfect run on the beatmap without any user interaction.
.TP
\fB\-\-pause\fR
Start the game in a paused state. Might be useful when you're starting the game
from a terminal as you won't be holding your mouse when the game starts.

.SH CONTROLS
.PP
The game is controlled from the keyboard and mouse. The keys are based on
osu!'s default settings, and rely on the \fIphysical\fR position on a QWERTY
keyboard. If you use a different keyboard layout, the keys are going to be at
the same position, even if the letters are different.
.SS Standard mode
.PP
Here are the official keys for the osu!standard mode:
.TP
\fBZ, X, mouse click\fR
Hit an object.
.SS Common keys
.PP
The following keys are common to all modes:
.TP
\fBEscape\fR
Toggle pause.
.TP
\fBPage up\fR
Rewind the song by 10 seconds, and leave a 1-second break.
.TP
\fBPage down\fR
Forward the song by 20 seconds.
.SS Pause
.PP
When the game is paused, the key layout for your region is used. Their
positions don't matter, but their letters do.
.TP
\fBQ\fR
Quit the game.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
oshu! currently doesn't read a configuration file, but reads the environment.
You may therefore easily configure oshu! from your .bashrc, or by creating a
wrapper script.
.PP
Here's the list of supported environment variables:
.TP
\fBOSHU_WINDOW_SIZE\fR
This variable specifies the default window size when the game start. Its value
must conform to the format \fI960x720\fR, where 960 is the width in pixels, and
720 the height in pixels. When omitted or invalid, the game starts with a
fallback default size of 960x720.
.TP
\fBOSHU_QUALITY\fR
This variables controls the visual effects and other rendering quality
settings. It may take one of \fIlow\fR, \fImedium\fR, and \fIhigh\fR. The
default is \fIhigh\fR.
